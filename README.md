Welcome to my very first web project! ðŸŽ‰

This website was created as part of a school assignment using only HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s a multi-page site with three unique sections:

The Historical Development of the Internet â€“ Explore how the internet has evolved over the years.

Tim Berners-Lee â€“ Learn about the creator of the World Wide Web and his contributions.

Agile Project Methodology â€“ A page dedicated to explaining the basics of working with agile methods in projects.

The website is fully responsive, designed to look great on a variety of screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
